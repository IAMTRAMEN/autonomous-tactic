## Autonomous Navigation Mobile Robot using ROS Navigation Stack.

In this project, the Eddie robot from Parallax has been modified to implement its autonomous navigation ability as well as other functionalities of a robotic system base on the Robot Operating System (ROS).

ROS navigation stack is used to provide the autonomous navigation functionality for our robot. The requirements to run the navigation stack properly based on our hardware specifications are fulfilled by implementing our own custom ROS packages as well as using existing packages provided by the ROS community.
